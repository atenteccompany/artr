# Code of Conduct

This project is maintained by AtenTEC and is released under the MIT license as a gesture to give back to the open-source community.

We’re passionate about building secure, maintainable, and high-quality software. We welcome contributors of all backgrounds and levels of experience — as long as we treat each other with respect and aim to make the software better for everyone.

## Our Standards

All contributors are expected to follow these principles:

- Be respectful. Technical disagreements are welcome, personal attacks are not.
- Communicate clearly. Use concise language, and be open to questions and feedback.
- Assume good intent. We’re all here to build and improve software, not win arguments.
- Keep things professional. This includes code, comments, commit messages, issues, and pull requests.
- Respect privacy and confidentiality. Don’t post logs, dumps, or any potentially sensitive info.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following actions are not tolerated:

- Harassment, trolling, or any form of discrimination (based on race, gender, nationality, ability, or otherwise)
- Use of offensive language, whether in code, comments, or discussion
- Publishing others’ private information, such as email or location, without explicit consent
- Intentionally degrading the software or creating malicious contributions

## Enforcement

This project is moderated by AtenTEC. Violations will be reviewed and addressed on a case-by-case basis. Outcomes may include warnings, temporary bans, or permanent exclusion from contributing, depending on severity.

If you observe behavior that violates this code, please contact us privately at: info@atentec.com
